complete all the Windows Updates and reboots
download lenovo vantage app and check that for system updates

see the orig readme to open admin powershell and then Set-ExeuctionPolicy
inspect each script incase i want to modify what is removed based on normal install or VM install
run these scripts with .\ prefix from powershell from orig admin account:

remove-onedrive
remove-default-apps       - may need to run this a few times if errors
disable-services
my-registry-tweaks
disable-scheduled-tasks

restart
then create limited user account but add it as admin for now
also download lenovo vantage for this account and configure

run all the scripts above again as limited
then reboot again

still should go through all pages of the Settings App and check if theres anything else to tweak

turn on bitlocker

then run this script:
install-basic-software

reboot

remove limited user from admins group

since auto updates are now turned off, we get frequent prompts for windows defender updates
